#PHP Script
This is a PHP script that creates a daily to-do list. It uses PHP Session to store the userâ€™s input across multiple pages 1. The script contains an HTML form that allows the user to enter a task and save it to the list. The list is stored in an array and is displayed on the same page. The user can add multiple tasks to the list, and the list will be updated accordingly. The script also checks if the task already exists in the list before adding it 1. The script uses Bootstrap 5 for styling.
